# **Sushi Go Round Python Script**

This script mainly depends on the module pyautogui to detect images and automate the clicking.
I came to know about it in [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), by Al Sweigart, in the last chapter where he explained how it worked, and spoke about making a script
such as this for a game, and took this game as an example, it was then I set out to try my luck in making one.
